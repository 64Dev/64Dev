I am a 15-year-old aspiring developer from Thailand, driven by a passion for technology. Despite limited academic support, I am determined to advance through self-guided study. My primary language is PHP, and I'm continuously striving to enhance my proficiency. While my English skills are a work in progress, I remain resolute in my pursuit of improvement.

Currently focused on PHP, my goal is to evolve into a proficient full-stack developer. I'm also well-versed in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've embarked on web app development using the Laravel framework. My expertise extends to other frameworks like ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS, and ViteJS. Alongside UI framework Bootstrap 5, I confidently navigate Adobe AI and PS.

Engaging in constant learning, I've honed my skills with livewire, AlpineJS, and various Laravel tools. Though PHP is less prevalent in Thailand, my ardor for the language remains unwavering. While I aspire to explore different languages, PHP remains close to my heart as the catalyst that sparked my journey. My dream is to share my knowledge in my homeland.

My moniker, "64," is emblematic of my progress. I encountered the number during my programming journey, symbolizing 64-bit systems, architecture, and the Thai year 2564, when my programming odyssey began. This name encapsulates my evolution as a developer.

In the future, I hope to share my creations and seek guidance to refine my endeavors. Your feedback is invaluable.
